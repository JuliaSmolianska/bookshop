    name: "You Could Make This Place Beautiful: A Memoir",
    author: "Maggie Smith",
    descriptionShort:
      "In her memoir You Could Make This Place Beautiful, poet Maggie Smith explores the disintegration of her marriage and her renewed commitment to herself in lyrical vignettes that shine, hard and clear as jewels.",
    description:
      "The book begins with one woman's personal, particular heartbreak, but its circles widen into a reckoning with contemporary womanhood, traditional gender roles, and the power dynamics that persist even in many progressive homes. With the spirit of self-inquiry and empathy she's known for, Smith interweaves snapshots of a life with meditations on secrets, anger, forgiveness, and narrative itself. The power of these pieces is cumulative: page after page, they build into a larger interrogation of family, work, and patriarchy.",

      "You Could Make This Place Beautiful is a sparklingly brilliant memoir-in-vignettes that only Maggie Smith could write. Yet this is a book for everyone--who among us has never had our world upended by the loss of a relationship? Maggie Smith's powerful mastery of language, and amazing ability to portray life in all its rich messiness, is on full display in this bold, brutally candid, and yes, beautiful, book.",

It's one chapter forward and five chapters back. You Could Make This Place Beautiful gave me back a part of myself I thought was gone for good: the knowledge that beauty isn't something out there to find. It's in us.",

    descriptionShort:
      "When she stumbles across the ad, she's looking for something else completely. But it seems like too good an opportunity to miss--a live-in nannying post, with a staggeringly generous salary. And when Rowan Caine arrives at Heatherbrae House, she is smitten--by the luxurious smart home fitted out with all modern conveniences, by the beautiful Scottish Highlands, and by this picture-perfect family.",
    description:
      "Writing to her lawyer from prison, she struggles to explain the events that led to her incarceration. It wasn't just the constant surveillance from the home's cameras, or the malfunctioning technology that woke the household with booming music, or turned the lights off at the worst possible time. It wasn't just the girls, who turned out to be a far cry from the immaculately behaved model children she met at her interview. It wasn't even the way she was left alone for weeks at a time, with no adults around apart from the enigmatic handyman.",

      "Ruth Ware-one of our favorite thriller writers--is bringing down the house... Read it for a fast-paced ride.",
    authorReviews1: "--theSkimm",
    reviews2:
      "Let's just say that if you've got an Echo, you're going to unplug it as soon as you finish the book... What Ware does beautifully is infuse The Turn of the Key with a creepy Gothic sensibility. For all of the novel's contemporary touches--particularly the house's malevolent smart technology--she has delivered an old-fashioned horror story, peopled by children with 'eyes full of malice, ' a dour housekeeper straight out of Rebecca and an inscrutable handyman.",
    authorReviews2: "--The New York Times Book Review",
    reviews3:
      "A clever and elegant update to James's story... Surveillance and home technology slot easily into the conventions of horror: They bring the sense that your environment is invaded and controlled from afar, and that you are never quite as alone as you might wish... The Turn of the Key, and novels like it, point to a new reality. We are all, constantly, haunted.",
